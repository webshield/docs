                    These WebShield (WS) Terms of Use (“Terms”) constitute a legally binding agreement
                    between you and WebShield, (“WS”, “we”, “us” or “our”). These Terms govern your access and use of
                    the SafetyPass Network (“App”).  By agreeing to these Terms, you confirm that you understand and
                    agree to be bound by these Terms with respect to your access to and use of the App.

                    Note that Section 15 of these Terms contains a mandatory arbitration provision that requires the use
                    of arbitration on an individual basis and limits the remedies available to you in the event of disputes
                    or claims in connection with these Terms or the App.

                    YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS WHEN YOU CONTINUE TO ACCESS OR USE THE APP. IF YOU DO NOT
                    UNDERSTAND OR AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS, DO NOT USE THE APP.
                </div>


                <h4>Privacy</h4>
                <div>
                    Your privacy is important to us and we are committed to protecting your information in accordance
                    with applicable laws and regulations and consistent with our established policies. Additionally, the
                    Privacy Policy which is incorporated into these Terms, describes how WS will collect information
                    about you through the App and how we use, disclose, and protect that information.
                </div>

                <h4>Eligibilty</h4>
                <div>
                    By accessing the App, you are agreeing to be bound by these Terms, all applicable laws, and regulations,
                    and agree that you are responsible for compliance with any applicable local laws. The App is not
                    targeted towards, nor intended for use by, anyone under the age of 13. If you are based outside the
                    United States, you must be over the age required by the laws of your country to use the App. By using
                    the App, you represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract with WS and
                    meet all of the foregoing eligibility requirements. If we become aware that we have the personal
                    data of such children collected through the App, we will promptly delete it.
                </div>

                <h4>Modifications</h4>
                <div>
                    WS reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the App, or any features
                    or portions of the App, without prior notice. WS may, at any time and from time to time, supplement,
                    amend, or otherwise change these Terms. Any changes to these Terms will be effective immediately
                    upon providing notice of the changes to you when you access the App. You agree to comply with,
                    and be bound by, the modified Terms either (i) by continuing to use or access the App after
                    receiving notice of the changes as described above or (ii) by not deleting the App.
                </div>

                        Copyright, trademark, patent, and other applicable laws may protect the App and materials appearing
                        on the App.  These are owned by WS, or for licensed content, the content providers.  Users may
                        access, save locally on the device, or print any materials appearing on the App for personal
                        use or other use within the scope allowed by these Terms.  No other use of these materials
                        may be made without express written permission of WS.

                        any advertising or publicity, or otherwise to indicate WS’s sponsorship of or affiliation
                        with any product or service, without express written permission from WS.  Nothing contained on
                        the App should be construed as granting, by implication, estoppel, waiver or otherwise, any
                        license or right of use to any trademark displayed on the Apps without the written permission
                        of WS or the third party owner of the trademark, if any. The App may contain other proprietary
                        notices and copyright information, the terms of which must be observed and followed.
